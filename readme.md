# Dice for Humanity

## What is this?

This repository contains high-quality, background-removed images of standard Dungeons & Dragons dice sets (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). Each die is photographed individually, oriented properly, sorted by color, and meticulously prepared as transparent PNG images. Because apparently, no one else on the entire internet thought humanity needed this.

## Why did I do this?

In my humble quest for simple, clean, and properly oriented images or scalable vector graphics (SVGs) of standard polyhedral dice sets, I discovered a horrifying truth: such resources simply don't exist online. Instead, we live in a dystopia overwhelmed by poorly lit photos of d20 dice with random numbers facing upwards—an affront to both order and decency.

Driven nearly to madness by the lack of proper dice imagery, I took matters into my own hands. I photographed my own dice, carefully positioned to show correct numbering, separated neatly by color, and painstakingly removed each background so that you, dear internet traveler, never have to suffer as I did.

## License and Ownership

These images are released without any license whatsoever. They are truly and utterly public domain. Use them for anything—personal projects, commercial products, tattoos, street art, space exploration manuals, whatever your heart desires. They belong not to me, nor any corporation, but to humanity itself.

## A Message to Wizards of the Coast (and the Pinkertons)

My current theory, paranoid though it may seem, is that the suspicious lack of quality dice imagery online is the doing of Wizards of the Coast, who perhaps secretly believe they own the Platonic solids themselves. But hear me clearly:

No corporation, wizardly or otherwise, can own the fundamental geometry that has been part of human culture and mathematical understanding for thousands of years. The Platonic solids belong to no single entity—they are a gift from mathematics, from nature, from the universe itself.

I do not fear Wizards of the Coast, nor the Pinkertons, nor any repercussions from my bold action. I place these images online, fully aware of the implications, returning them freely and irrevocably to humanity.

Dice are for everyone.

You're welcome, world.
